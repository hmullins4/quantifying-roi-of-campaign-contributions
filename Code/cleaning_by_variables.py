""" Within this table, there are a variety of variables that
simply introduce clutter; many of the variables are identifiers,
metadata, redundant, or advanced ideological scores that are not
related to the analysis of this project. Identifiers/names are 
not predictors of votes, and NIMSP (National Institute for Money
in State Politics) come from state-level sources when I've already
filtered to the house level. Ideological scores, though interesting,
will not affect a candidate's probability of winning. Additionally,
metadata from the other tables would be useful for the source mix, 
but in this table it does not serve me. 

Variables that are especially or may be relevant:
    
    cycle --- Election cycle (year)
    bonica_rid --- Candidate ID to join
    bonica_cid --- Candidate ID to join
    party --- Party code (for party fixed-effects)
    district --- Congressional district (for fixed effects and/or
                                          clustering)
    ico_status --- Incumbency status
    num_givers --- Number of distinct donors
    total_receipts --- Total dollar amount raised
    total_disbursements --- Total spent
    total_indiv_contribs --- Amount from individuals
    total_unitemized --- Small gifts (usually "micro" donors)
    total_pac_contribs --- Amount from PACs
    total_party_contribs --- Amount from party committees
    total_contribs_from_candidate --- Candidate self-financing
    ind_exp_support --- Independent expenditures for candidate
    ind_exp_oppose --- Independent expenditures against candidate
    gen_vote_pct --- General-election vote share (continuous outcome)
    gwinner --- General-election win indicator (binary outcome)
    district_pres_vs --- District-level precentage of the two-party
                            vote share won by Democratic presidential
                            nominee in most recent/concurrent presi-
