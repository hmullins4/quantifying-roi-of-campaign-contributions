""" 
The database being utilized in this script is the dime_v4.sqlite3 database, found
at the Database on Ideology, Money in Politics, and Elections website through Stanford
University. In this capstone project, I intend to only utilize data on U.S. House
elections, so through this script, I will filter the data I currently have based on
this restriction and place it in a new database for efficiency and space.
